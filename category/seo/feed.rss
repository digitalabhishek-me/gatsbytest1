										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><b>TOP 5 SEO </b><b>S</b><b>TRATEGIES </b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engine optimization is a process of growing quality traffic on a website by increasing its visibility to the users of any search engine. It ranks a website on different search engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO is the most effective web marketing strategy and is widely adopted. In the drastically changing digital landscape, SEO is still on top.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Haven&#8217;t you seen many websites that move quickly through google ranking?</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t be distressed. Remember these websites were once at your place. There are several ways to increase search engine rankings. Your competitors might be using it for ages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of people never binge on other pages of google. They get everything on a single page, which means the content on the other pages gets just 10-15% of traffic. This indicates the importance of Google rankings. To list on the first page of Google or any other search engine, you must need to adopt SEO techniques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we have compiled the best 5 SEO strategies to take you to page 1 of Google and other search engines. To understand these tactics you don&#8217;t need to have a Ph.D. in the subject matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>1.Keyword strategy to drive more traffic</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To drive traffic to your website, you need people to visit your site. You must know what they are looking for, and which keywords they use or prefer while navigating a site. In short, you need a keyword strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple words, the keyword strategy is to find out what terms to be used and taking every decision based upon the findings. It is a strategy to target the most popular keywords now and in future.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5337" src="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2.png" alt="a35af6 57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75 mv2 TOP 5 SEO STRATEGIES ( You Should Definitely Consider )" width="1000" height="571" srcset="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2.png 1000w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2-300x171.png 300w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2-768x439.png 768w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2-600x343.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start it by investigating your website, your products, and your competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to some professionals, it may be outdated but it is not true. Let me explain its importance:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword research tells you what topics people actually care about. Assume that you have the right SEO tool, imagine how popular your blogs will be. Keyword research will be helpful in sorting the topic you want to create the content on.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to use keyword strategy?</span></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a list of relevant topics depending upon your business.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fill it up with specific keywords.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research about the terms related to your search.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of keywords, i.e. head terms and long-tail keywords. Head terms are generally shorter and generic keywords whereas long-tail keywords are longer phrases. For a better result, use both of them to exaggerate your content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a look at the competitor&#8217;s keyword strategy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you are done!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to re-evaluate the keywords after every few months and you can also add as many keywords as you want.</span></p>

<h4><b>2.CONTENT STRATEGY</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content is the most essential part of SEO. Creating content is not as simple as it seems. Millions of blogs are posted daily, so what makes your content different is the most important question that arises. This is the question that makes strategy play its game. Strategic content involves professional planning and execution.</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Steps to building a content strategy</span></h4>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly update the existing content.</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><b>3.Infographics</b></h4>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does using images can be helpful for SEO?</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infographics represent data, concepts, and techniques visually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may sound unrealistic but its true infographics can help in driving the traffic. Infographics convey content in a digestible format.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It explains a complicated topic with ease. It simplifies complex information. They make information alive. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5339" src="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/What_is_an_Infographic_Blog_Header.png" alt="What is an Infographic Blog Header TOP 5 SEO STRATEGIES ( You Should Definitely Consider )" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/What_is_an_Infographic_Blog_Header.png 1024w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/What_is_an_Infographic_Blog_Header-300x169.png 300w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/What_is_an_Infographic_Blog_Header-768x432.png 768w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/What_is_an_Infographic_Blog_Header-600x338.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years it has gained a lot of popularity on social media. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gives a unique twist to the content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving too much and extensive information may lead to boredom in the content. Infographics create interest in people.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of best tips for infographics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thought automatically comes into the mind of users. Here we have the solution.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use jpeg or png images to maintain quality.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the optimal size of images while keeping in mind that its quality should not be affected.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a caption just below the images so that readers could easily get the motive behind the image.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name your picture so that search engines could easily represent your pictures.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>4.Social media</b></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5340" src="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Top-9-Benefits-of-Social-Media-for-Your-Business-1520x800-1.png" alt="Top 9 Benefits of Social Media for Your Business 1520x800 1 TOP 5 SEO STRATEGIES ( You Should Definitely Consider )" width="1520" height="800" srcset="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Top-9-Benefits-of-Social-Media-for-Your-Business-1520x800-1.png 1520w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Top-9-Benefits-of-Social-Media-for-Your-Business-1520x800-1-300x158.png 300w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Top-9-Benefits-of-Social-Media-for-Your-Business-1520x800-1-1024x539.png 1024w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Top-9-Benefits-of-Social-Media-for-Your-Business-1520x800-1-768x404.png 768w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Top-9-Benefits-of-Social-Media-for-Your-Business-1520x800-1-600x316.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1520px) 100vw, 1520px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of contradictions about social media’s impact on Google rankings and SEO. But before going through the impacts, it is necessary to know that google rankings are not a perfect science. Rankings don&#8217;t work as a “secret tool”. Google rankings don’t give detailed information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media indirectly affects google rankings and SEO.  Social doesn’t count likes, comments or followers as likes, as followers or comments can be manipulated easily. Consequently, lesser valuable sites may get higher rankings. Moreover, social media’s posts change continuously so it would be difficult to cope up with the changing posts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>5.Creation of links</b></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5341" src="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/link-building.png" alt="link building TOP 5 SEO STRATEGIES ( You Should Definitely Consider )" width="960" height="440" srcset="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/link-building.png 960w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/link-building-300x138.png 300w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/link-building-768x352.png 768w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/link-building-600x275.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a practice of building one-way backlinks to a website to drive the traffic and improve the visibility of the website. It includes marketing, building useful tools, and public relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more number of links represents that the search engine will more evaluate your website.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps to link building</span></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to know what your audience wants. Targeting the audience is the foremost step. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out the websites already dealing with the targeted audience. Creating links with such websites may be helpful in reaching the new audience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write content that would affect the audience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compare your content with the competitor’s content.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Final words</b></h4>

Always includes changes in your website in respect to compete with the changing scenario. Words matter a lot, focus on the content you are writing.</span></p>

<em>&#8212; Security certificates are a must-have for better SEO.</em><br />
<em>&#8212; Selecting keywords according to your niche is essential.</em></p>
<p>SEO is divided into two major segments referred to as On-Page SEO and Off-Page SEO. Following simple steps taking both segments in mind can help you achieve better results. Though there are other hacks too that can lead to better SEO ranking of your website which we will be mentioned below. However, keeping in mind what goes into a website is always an important factor to consider.</p>

<h3>Content Relevancy and URL&#8217;s</h3>
<p>Content relevancy and URL&#8217;s are considered best practices for On-Page SEO development. while there are hundreds and thousands of free templates available on content for a particular niche. Writing your own content can create much more needed relevancy for google to identify your uniqueness. Also, contents need to be authentic and strict to the point. While developing a website make sure you add content that is fresh and interesting. On the other hand, URL branding can also help Google to identify and index your website on SERP&#8217;s. Effective URL branding for E.g www.brandname.com/sales/getintouch.html can generate better results than www.brandname.com/title/2035687.html. Make sure to properly brand and identify your URL&#8217;s before indexing it on google</p>
<h3>Title Tags, Meta Tags</h3>
<p>Title tags are titles that help the browser know what the page is all about. These are coded in as Title in HTML codes for the browser to identify the page description. On the other hand, meta tags are descriptions or content that your page offers embedded below the title tags. An effective title and meta tags matching relevant search keywords can help your webpage ranking up to 30%. However, do make sure it&#8217;s unethical to stuff keywords in that which is not encouraged by google and certainly affect your ranking.</p>

<h3>Link building and Socializing</h3>
<p>Taking to businesses with similar niches and building links to and fro can also help you get a boost in your Google ranking. The more links to your website appear on the different website the more traffic you receive. The Process is also known as link building. However, building random links to every other website would be a big no for your ranking. Meanwhile posting links to your website on your social media pages and creating engagements leading to your website can also help get you your target audience. The more the visits the more garner you receive in your ranking. Link building and socializing are a part of Off-page Seo which should not be taken lightly.</p>
<h3>SSL certificates and Sitemaps</h3>

With an active SSL certificate, Google adds your website to the secure list of websites. A website with no SSL certificate would always yield poor ranking in spite of all your SEO efforts. It is one of the key requirements for a website to have. Sitemaps, on the other hand, is the Index of the website like that of a book. With the proper sitemap, indexing on google becomes easier and relevant. Every time you update your website, make sure to submit the updated sitemaps too on Google Search Console.</p>

The process may take time as it takes almost a month just for a website to index properly on Google, However, in the longer run, it would certainly yield results. You can achieve much better organic traffic in just a matter month by following the above-mentioned techniques, However, efforts and patience is the key to all of it as the famous saying goes &#8220;Rome was not built in a day&#8221;.</em></p>
