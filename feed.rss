<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand consistency and recognition is a great challenge for every marketer. It is much more than a colorful photo. A brand is an image in the mind of customers. A brand name is created by a consistent approach across every interaction. </span></p>

Social media increases your online presence. It can personify an enterprise. 86% of marketers have accepted that online marketing has proved advantageous for their firm.</span></p>
<h4><b><i>Here we are compiling the top 5  strategies to make social marketing more effective and overwhelming.</i></b></h4>
<hr />
<h4><b>1. WANT TO SLAY? YOU HAVE TO PAY!</b></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5381 aligncenter" src="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/isometric-3d-ppc-paid-per-clik-advertising-advertisement-concept_25147-205.jpg" alt="isometric 3d ppc paid per clik advertising advertisement concept 25147 205 TOP 5 SOCIAL STRATEGY TO BOOST YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA" width="626" height="402" srcset="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/isometric-3d-ppc-paid-per-clik-advertising-advertisement-concept_25147-205.jpg 626w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/isometric-3d-ppc-paid-per-clik-advertising-advertisement-concept_25147-205-300x193.jpg 300w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/isometric-3d-ppc-paid-per-clik-advertising-advertisement-concept_25147-205-600x385.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the social media platforms either Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, youtube, Tik Tok, or Snapchat have some form of paid advertisement. It is a cost-effective way to promote business on the web and is different from outbound advertising. This ensures the visibility of your content and diverts traffic to your website.</span></p>
<h5><b>Benefits of paid advertising </b></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It amplifies your reach and gives instant visibility. Unpaid ads may not get a priority but paid ads guaranteed a place in the social media feed. Hence,  generates a direct window to the website traffic</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">This fits into any budget. It uses a PPC ( pay per click ) payment method under which you only pay if the user does what you want.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In paid advertising you have control over who is seeing your ad. This can be helpful in targeting customers. You can create a list of audience based on psychographic factors like interests and hobbies, etc. and then you can expand and engage the ideal audience.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">It creates brand awareness. For instance, you see a brand daily on your feed. Wouldn&#8217;t you start recognizing it? Similarly paid advertisement shows your product daily on the user’s feed and hence creating brand recognition.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">This distributes the best content and is an ideal way to spread your content.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><b>2. WANT TO EXAGGERATE? USE VISUAL BRANDING!</b></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-5376 aligncenter" src="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hand-putting-brand-word-written-wooden-ball_51195-1240.jpg" alt="hand putting brand word written wooden ball 51195 1240 TOP 5 SOCIAL STRATEGY TO BOOST YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA" width="626" height="417" srcset="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hand-putting-brand-word-written-wooden-ball_51195-1240.jpg 626w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hand-putting-brand-word-written-wooden-ball_51195-1240-300x200.jpg 300w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hand-putting-brand-word-written-wooden-ball_51195-1240-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px"></p>
<h4><b>37% of marketers failed to understand the concept of visual branding, especially on social media. </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has a simple meaning. This means ensuring you have visual content, i.e. color schemes, fonts, videos, and symbols, etc. It styles your brand. This is a kind of framework that shows how you put your ideas into action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The human brain processes images faster than the text. It remembers what it sees more than what it reads or listens to. People will recognize your brand without even seeing the logo with the help of the visuals you create.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media prefers video content as it engages the viewers on their channels. Original and engaging videos help brands stand apart even in the toughest competition.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h5><b>Benefits of visual branding on social media</b></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It catches the eye of people and it increases the willingness to read content by 80%.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has a better recall rate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes the brand consistent.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They require less cost than hiring a professional videographer/photographer.</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4><b>3. WANT TO BUILD GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS? COMMUNICATE DIGITALLY!</b></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5377" src="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min.jpg" alt="3286556 min TOP 5 SOCIAL STRATEGY TO BOOST YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA" width="2000" height="2000" srcset="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min.jpg 2000w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min-300x300.jpg 300w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min-150x150.jpg 150w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min-768x768.jpg 768w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min-550x550.jpg 550w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min-1100x1100.jpg 1100w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min-600x600.jpg 600w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3286556-min-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s world, people prefer fewer telephonic conversations when it comes to enquiring about a business. They go for the information published online. It is time-efficient to connect with a firm through emails and chat process. In older days people had to visit the business to seek any kind of information but nowadays we can get it on a single click.</span></p>
<h5><b>Social marketing communications can be proved effective if these principles are followed:</b></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand is promoted consistently.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotion is integrated with product, price, and placement. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus of communication must be on pro-social behavior change.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Benefits of good digital communication</b></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is more interactive and participatory.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication is instant.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is more convenient than visiting the business.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital communications can have a track.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4><b>4.TRY TO BE RESPONSIVE</b></h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers who ignore customer&#8217;s queries and do not respond are not likely to survive in a market in the long run. A customer not getting any response from the retailer is probably going to explore a new and responsive site. There are a number of ways to answer customer queries. Always try to respond as soon as possible. Ask yourself whether you respond to customer calls? How much time do you take to respond to customer mail? Responding within 24 hours creates a good image of your business. It eliminates potential pitfalls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>5.CREATE A DIFFERENT ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENT PLATFORM</b></h4>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5379" src="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1.jpg" alt="3380861 min 1 TOP 5 SOCIAL STRATEGY TO BOOST YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA" width="2000" height="2000" srcset="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1.jpg 2000w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1-550x550.jpg 550w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1-1100x1100.jpg 1100w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1-600x600.jpg 600w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3380861-min-1-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are dealing with a diverse range of products then create multiple social accounts. As you all know that different social media sites have different age groups of people. Target the audience. Find out which social site users are of which age groups and have what kind of interests. After targeting the specific audience, post the relevant content. For example, if you are dealing with products like ring lights, selfie sticks, cameras then promote your products at video-making apps like tik tok, youtube, vidmate, etc. while if you are dealing with household essentials post it on Facebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at your products and see where to promote them to get the best results.</span></p>
<h5><b>Benefits of creating multiple accounts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It increases brand awareness.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><b>TOP 5 SEO </b><b>S</b><b>TRATEGIES </b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search engine optimization is a process of growing quality traffic on a website by increasing its visibility to the users of any search engine. It ranks a website on different search engines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO is the most effective web marketing strategy and is widely adopted. In the drastically changing digital landscape, SEO is still on top.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b><i>Haven&#8217;t you seen many websites that move quickly through google ranking?</i></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t be distressed. Remember these websites were once at your place. There are several ways to increase search engine rankings. Your competitors might be using it for ages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of people never binge on other pages of google. They get everything on a single page, which means the content on the other pages gets just 10-15% of traffic. This indicates the importance of Google rankings. To list on the first page of Google or any other search engine, you must need to adopt SEO techniques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we have compiled the best 5 SEO strategies to take you to page 1 of Google and other search engines. To understand these tactics you don&#8217;t need to have a Ph.D. in the subject matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>1.Keyword strategy to drive more traffic</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To drive traffic to your website, you need people to visit your site. You must know what they are looking for, and which keywords they use or prefer while navigating a site. In short, you need a keyword strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In simple words, the keyword strategy is to find out what terms to be used and taking every decision based upon the findings. It is a strategy to target the most popular keywords now and in future.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5337" src="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2.png" alt="a35af6 57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75 mv2 TOP 5 SEO STRATEGIES ( You Should Definitely Consider )" width="1000" height="571" srcset="https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2.png 1000w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2-300x171.png 300w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2-768x439.png 768w, https://softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a35af6_57805b94f55b404e8e01dc2288fedd75_mv2-600x343.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start it by investigating your website, your products, and your competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to some professionals, it may be outdated but it is not true. Let me explain its importance:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyword research tells you what topics people actually care about. Assume that you have the right SEO tool, imagine how popular your blogs will be. Keyword research will be helpful in sorting the topic you want to create the content on.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to use keyword strategy?</span></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a list of relevant topics depending upon your business.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fill it up with specific keywords.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research about the terms related to your search.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of keywords, i.e. head terms and long-tail keywords. Head terms are generally shorter and generic keywords whereas long-tail keywords are longer phrases. For a better result, use both of them to exaggerate your content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a look at the competitor&#8217;s keyword strategy.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you are done!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to re-evaluate the keywords after every few months and you can also add as many keywords as you want.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gives a unique twist to the content.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lots of contradictions about social media’s impact on Google rankings and SEO. But before going through the impacts, it is necessary to know that google rankings are not a perfect science. Rankings don&#8217;t work as a “secret tool”. Google rankings don’t give detailed information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media indirectly affects google rankings and SEO.  Social doesn’t count likes, comments or followers as likes, as followers or comments can be manipulated easily. Consequently, lesser valuable sites may get higher rankings. Moreover, social media’s posts change continuously so it would be difficult to cope up with the changing posts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>5.Creation of links</b></h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing your socials can be very challenging when there is a lot already going on in your plate. Especially for business individuals who constantly thinking about making more and more and adding value to their business every day. However, missing on your socials cant be an option especially when you want to brand it and attract more customers.</p>
<p>When asked for most small business owners that why are they missing on their social and business branding in spite of spending a considerable amount of time on Facebook, and Other Social Media platforms. The answer is either they don&#8217;t have enough time to work on branding their business or lack the proper knowledge to do it. Considering time as a criterion and knowledge as an insight. its time to shed some light on how to effectively manage your social branding when your time is limited.</p>
<p><strong>1. Posts Scheduling</strong>:- Scheduling your post before time is the best way to make sure your social media pages are active, alive, and kicking. There are many posts scheduler out there like HootSuite, Buffer, Zoho Social, etc and you can try their free and paid plan as per your usage. An organization with the proper targeted and segmented audience can perform effectively with just for free. However, in order to schedule your posts, you require a lot of content and pre-planning to what goes into the account at what time according to advanced analytics and decoding that is the key to effective posts scheduling. Considering what needs to be sent and when requires a plan. which brings us to the next topic of Pre-planning.</p>
<p><strong>2. Pre Planning</strong>: &#8211; Pre-planning is considered as of the best and effective strategies to manage and properly maximize your posts scheduling outcomes. All you need is a laptop or a phone, some amazing designs, a few stories, and a lot of creative content planned before scheduling your posts. Few points to consider while preplanning can be understanding your target audience, Age group, Response parameters, time metrics, etc. While these things can be a little tricky to understand in the initial days, However making sure you get something out there to your audience is the key.</p>
<p><strong>3. Intermediate Quick Posts</strong>: Along with Scheduling and Pre Planning, one thing that adds a kick to the account is Quick intermediate posts. This works a surprise element for you as it is quick, raw, and real. A meeting someone interesting, A visual strategy that you came across. A thought or just random posts. All that matters. In the end, it all boils down to create your own audience and evolve your brand.</p>
<p><strong>4. Hire a full-time Social Media Manager</strong>: &#8211; Well if all these above tasks seem a lot more work for you to do then best is to go for a full-time social media manager. I would always recommend an in house one despite me managing a digital marketing firm myself and the only reason being is that personal connection. If you already have staff that works for you on different roles. Ask them to open on Social media and spent some time in branding the company. Well this has its own set of problems as the results may seem erratic haywire as there is no pre-planning or result evaluation mechanics are involved, However, it still seems pretty handy when you have a confined set of audience to cater.</p>
<p>While effective use of Social media can get you free organic traffic and boost your overall SEO. It is very important that you plan on things beforehand and then automate the process. Get in touch with some social media experts or get a dip check done. Your business requirements may be different from what someone else wants out of his.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SEO Stands for Search Engine Optimization and most of it often find it very difficult to get it correctly or find it hard to get their pages to rank</p>
<h4>Let&#8217;s get a few things straightened up while we move forward</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>&#8212; Google Ranks website with content relevancy and visits.</em><br />
<em>&#8212; Authencity is the key</em><br />
<em>&#8212; Your social media affects your website rankings</em><br />
<em>&#8212; Security certificates are a must-have for better SEO.</em><br />
<em>&#8212; Selecting keywords according to your niche is essential.</em></p>
<p>SEO is divided into two major segments referred to as On-Page SEO and Off-Page SEO. Following simple steps taking both segments in mind can help you achieve better results. Though there are other hacks too that can lead to better SEO ranking of your website which we will be mentioned below. However, keeping in mind what goes into a website is always an important factor to consider.</p>
<h3>Do you know a website with relevant content, Proper indexing, and frequent cross-location visits can increase your website ranking up to 40%?</h3>
<p>Considering the above-mentioned factors lets discuss the effective way to get you free SEO Traffic</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-269 size-full" src="https://blog.softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3432978.jpg" alt="3432978 Effective Ways to build an SEO Audience for FREE" width="2000" height="2000"></p>
<h3>Content Relevancy and URL&#8217;s</h3>
<p>Content relevancy and URL&#8217;s are considered best practices for On-Page SEO development. while there are hundreds and thousands of free templates available on content for a particular niche. Writing your own content can create much more needed relevancy for google to identify your uniqueness. Also, contents need to be authentic and strict to the point. While developing a website make sure you add content that is fresh and interesting. On the other hand, URL branding can also help Google to identify and index your website on SERP&#8217;s. Effective URL branding for E.g www.brandname.com/sales/getintouch.html can generate better results than www.brandname.com/title/2035687.html. Make sure to properly brand and identify your URL&#8217;s before indexing it on google</p>
<h3>Title Tags, Meta Tags</h3>
<p>Title tags are titles that help the browser know what the page is all about. These are coded in as Title in HTML codes for the browser to identify the page description. On the other hand, meta tags are descriptions or content that your page offers embedded below the title tags. An effective title and meta tags matching relevant search keywords can help your webpage ranking up to 30%. However, do make sure it&#8217;s unethical to stuff keywords in that which is not encouraged by google and certainly affect your ranking.</p>

<h3>Link building and Socializing</h3>
<p>Taking to businesses with similar niches and building links to and fro can also help you get a boost in your Google ranking. The more links to your website appear on the different website the more traffic you receive. The Process is also known as link building. However, building random links to every other website would be a big no for your ranking. Meanwhile posting links to your website on your social media pages and creating engagements leading to your website can also help get you your target audience. The more the visits the more garner you receive in your ranking. Link building and socializing are a part of Off-page Seo which should not be taken lightly.</p>
<h3>SSL certificates and Sitemaps</h3>
<p>Having an SSL certificate on the website identifies it as safe and secure for browsing and it is the first thing you should go buy while buying your domain for your business. With an active SSL certificate, Google adds your website to the secure list of websites. A website with no SSL certificate would always yield poor ranking in spite of all your SEO efforts. It is one of the key requirements for a website to have. Sitemaps, on the other hand, is the Index of the website like that of a book. With the proper sitemap, indexing on google becomes easier and relevant. Every time you update your website, make sure to submit the updated sitemaps too on Google Search Console.</p>
<p><em>With all being said effective use of On-page SEO, Off-page SEO, and Google Search Console, you can increase your website ranking with almost no advertising. The process may take time as it takes almost a month just for a website to index properly on Google, However, in the longer run, it would certainly yield results. You can achieve much better organic traffic in just a matter month by following the above-mentioned techniques, However, efforts and patience is the key to all of it as the famous saying goes &#8220;Rome was not built in a day&#8221;.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We come across with this line almost every day now and is also emphasized by most social gurus and big data CEO&#8217;s out there. the transformation of companies from just being driven by innovative products and introducing them in the market to a more content-driven media influencing entity wide-spreading their brand instead of just marketing their product is the most which are catching eyeballs in the recent years.</p>
<p>This paradigm shift of businesses to focus more and more on the content and posting it out on the web and marketing it out is what making them a recognizable face today, however, what made this shift is the question. How the focus from the traditional selling business model changed to a more conservative and broader approach which is not anymore just about selling stuff. What made content the king and marketing the queen as we know today and stomp our feet every day to be more content-driven.</p>
<h2>Here is the list of things that I believe the way for this bold content beast to be the king.</h2>
<h3>Creativity Wins</h3>
<p>There is no doubt about this that creativity always wins, Yes it does takes time to reach its potential as creativity demands change, However, if it had not been for creativity, we would still have been figuring out how to a wheel can change our lives. I recently watched an interview with two of the creative industry expert Mr. Ankur Warikoo, Founder of Nearbuy.com and Tanmay Bhatt, Co-Founder All India Bakchod who specifically emphasized what providing creative freedom to the media team can do. Since the invention of advertising and media, its always been the content which is more creative gets a better share of the market. Be it an add showing fish sticking to a stick with just a few drops of five stick or a meme showing Darth Vader instructing their commanders to stop being a jerk. Its the creative content that connects to your emotions and then yourself to a brand. It is very important for every company today to have an inhouse media team working specifically to create and distribute content that is driven by creativity and out of the box thinking and it only requires freedom to express their thoughts.</p>
<h3>No one cares</h3>
<p>The fact that we think everyone cares what we do is more a less a false assumption these days as that what restricts you to think out of the box. On the contrary, no one really cares what you are up to and what you do until something grabs their attention and distracts them to think about you. Even if you successfully manage to grab an eyeball, you would hardly be remembered again. We are constantly fed with information every second of a minute and the timespan to stay on a particular piece of information has reduced fairly. a supposed talk of the town today might be tailender tomorrow. You have to constantly come up with things every now and then, things or content that matter or do not even matter without falling in the trap of being judged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-263 size-full" src="https://blog.softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/43057-scaled.jpg" alt="43057 scaled Why content is the king and marketing is the queen today?" width="2560" height="1862"></p>
<h3>Social media disaster</h3>
<p>With social media at your disposal, content is flushed in our lives at a rapid rate. We truly emphasize on a piece of information that only matters to us piling rest on to the social trash bin. The story remains the same showing the same name again and again and again with different altercations is what makes you stand out. In a context, an ad can do wonders for you and get an undesirable result and on the other hand, another campaign might just burn your cash out. In the end, it all boils down to the message that connects. It is fairly possible that a certain segment of a society connects with something and others relate to something else. The key is to put out content understanding your target audiences&#8217; demographics.</p>
<h3>Timeframe shift</h3>
<p>As per the recent study, we stick on to a piece of information only for a mere eight seconds. The timeframe to attract your audience has taken huge downward dive with an increasing number of social media platforms and mobile apps on our phone. Convincing someone in just a mere 8 seconds is what the game is all about now and the only strategic way to approach at it is trying your hands at different content based marketing methods. One important factor which these above-mentioned gentlemen covered was not to rely on any particular big-budget ad campaign but also to run a good number of small budgeted campaigns too. There is no doubt that the big-budget campaign would certainly help you to penetrate through the chaos, however, the small budgeted would help you stick and stay.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-264 size-full" src="https://blog.softwaremechanics.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3024038-scaled.jpg" alt="3024038 scaled Why content is the king and marketing is the queen today?" width="2560" height="1707"></p>
<p>When thoroughly given a thought about what matters the most is not the content that you put in but the quality and regularity of the marketing strategy. It&#8217;s not anymore about what you market which still remains at its core however its how often you market and with what content and ideas at your disposal. For a business looking to branch out and expand, it is very important for them to understand the above statement and act on it to stay in the big game. Content is king and marketing as queen is I believe what truly is carrying the business marketing torch ahead and will carry on to do so in the times moving forward.</p>
